The concept is very similar to Ruby on Rails idea of seeding a database. This allows a new developer to pull down the source code for a project (which contains .json files to populate their mongodb with) and run a command and bingo!! database populated and ready to rock.\r\n\r\n## Usage\r\n\r\n- Run `$ npm install -g node-mongo-seeds`\r\n- Run `$ seed-setup` from the root of your project to generate a `seed.json` file\r\n- Replace `\"localhost/LOCAL_DB_NAME\"` with the path to your mongodb in your brand new seed.json file\r\n- Create a `/seeds` folder in your project root and put `.json` files in there.\r\n\t\tThe name of the file is going to be the collection name in mongo and the contents\r\n\t\tof the file will be populated into that mongo collection.\r\n\t- Note that this package supports the [mongo-extended-json syntax](https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/reference/mongodb-extended-json/)\r\n- Run `$ seed` to seed your mongodb with all your data from your `/seeds` folder.\r\n\r\n**Note**: Every time you run `$ seed` it will blow away all the data in your collections and re-populate them with whatever is in your `/seeds` directory.\r\n\r\n### Separate databases per NODE_ENV\r\n\r\nYou can have separate databases for each NODE_ENV that you are using. Just a put a line in seed.json for each `NODE_ENV` that you are going to use. It defaults to `undefined`, `dev`, and `prod` but can be changed to whatever.\r\n\r\n## Contributing\r\n\r\n1. Clone project and run `npm install -g ./` from project root\r\n2. Add feature(s) \r\n3. Add tests for it\r\n4. Submit pull request\r\n\r\n### Running Tests\r\n\r\nTo run the tests, follow these instructions.\r\n\r\n1. Start mongod process\t\t\r\n2. From project root `$ npm install`\t\r\n3. Run test command `$ npm test`\r\n\r\nEnjoy!\r\n",
